Hi, I am Tade Strehk, a Computer Science student from Germany.

Beside my studies at University, I am currently working on a voluntary project for Deutsche Model United Nations e.V. (DMUN, engl. German Model United Nations Society), where I develope the frontend of a Chairing and Debate Management Software for Model United Nations Conferences (and similar).

Besides that, I have many small side projects, including some microelectronic projects related to my smart home setup and others in similar categories.
